# SynoAppsDocs
The aim of SynoAppsDocs is to provide documentation on applications using Syno ExtJS framework<br><br>

This part includes :
- A tar of the apps/modules docs : to document how apps are using the UI components and framework (in the docs folder)

This repo doesn't include :
- The SPK package for SynoAppsDocs. For that refer to the SynoAppsDocs source in the useful links section available in the [Synology DSM info](https://github.com/DigitalBox98/SynoAppsDocs/wiki/Synology-DSM-info) page 

Notes : 
- The package part is generated via SPKSRC
